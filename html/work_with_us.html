            We are more than a group of students with a pation for motorsport.
            FSUM represents the first step in the formation of top engineers.
            Our members will enter the job market with experience and skills 
            that will make them stand out. 
            We want to offer students the chance of being part of group that 
            values everyone's work and pushes all members to show their full
            potencial. 
            Investing in our project means investing in the next generation of
            engineers and making shure that they gather as much experience as possible
            so that some day in the future they make a difference and push technology foward.

                    Motorsport isn't cheap at all.
                    Expences start accumulating in the development of the car and can reach a great ammount 
                    when we start competing. Supporting financially our project helps us manage all the expences

                    In order to build the car that we are

                    helps us take the car from the modeling software to the race track.
