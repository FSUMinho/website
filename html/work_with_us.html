            that will make them stand out. <br>
            We want to offer students the chance of being part of group that 
            values everyone's work and pushes all members to show their full
            potencial. <br>
            Investing in our project means investing in the next generation of
            engineers and making shure that thy gather as much experience as possible
            so that some day in the future they make a diference and push technology foward.

            How to invest
        </h1>

        <p class="how-to-invest-text text">
            <span style="color:#084d6e">Monetary support</span>: Motorsport isn't cheap at all.
            Expences start accumulating in the development of the car and can reach a great ammount 
            when we start competing. Supporting financially our project helps us menage all the expences
            all reach our goals. <br>

            <span style="color:#084d6e">Supply materials</span>: In order to build the car that we are 
            designing, we'll need to gather various materials. Supplying materials to the teams 
            helps us take the car from the modeling software to the race track. <br>

            <span style="color:#084d6e">knowledge</span>: Even though we consider ourselves very skilled
            and talented, knowledge is never enough. We are always open to learn from actual profetionals from 
            our areas of expertise.
